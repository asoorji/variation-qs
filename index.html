"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "Let the first term of the AP be 'a' and the common difference be 'd'. Then, we have: a + 6d = 15 (since the 7th term is 15), a + 9d = 2(a + 4d) (since the 10th term is twice the 5th term). Simplifying this equation, we get: a = 4d. Substituting this value of a in the first equation, we get: 4d + 6d = 15, which gives d = 3. Therefore, the common difference of the AP is 3."

"explanation": "The sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by the formula: Sn = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term and d is the common difference. Using this formula, we can write two equations for the given problem: 6/2(2a + 5d) = 60 and 10/2(2a + 5d) - 6/2(2a + 5d) = 44. Simplifying these equations, we get 2a + 5d = 20 and 2a + 9d = 52. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get a = 3 and d = 5. Therefore, the correct option is a=3, d=5."
