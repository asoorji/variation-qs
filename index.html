"question": "If y varies inversely with x, and y = 6 when x = 2, find the value of y when x = 5.",
"options": ["2", "4", "7", "15"],
"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "If y varies inversely with x, then y = k/x for some constant k. To find the value of k, we can use the given values: 6 = k/2, which gives k = 12. Substituting k into the formula, we get y = 12/x. When x = 5, y = 12/5 = 2.4. Therefore, the correct option is 2."

"explanation": "If y varies directly with x, then y = kx for some constant k. To find the value of k, we can use the given values: 15 = k(5), which gives k = 3. Substituting k into the formula, we get y = 3x. When x = 10, y = 3(10) = 30. Therefore, the correct option is 25."

"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "If y varies directly with the square of x, then y = kx^2 for some constant k. To find the value of k, we can use the given values: 12 = k(3^2), which gives k = 4. Substituting k into the formula, we get y = 4x^2. When x = 6, y = 4(6^2) = 144. Therefore, the correct option is 24."

"explanation": "If y varies inversely with the square of x, then y = k/x^2 for some constant k. To find the value of k, we can use the given values: 2 = k/5^2, which gives k = 50. Substituting k into the formula, we get y = 50/x^2. When x = 10, y = 50/10^2 = 0.5. Therefore, the correct option is 0.5."
